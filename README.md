# TeamGenerator

This is my submission for Node/OOP homework. At this point, this is not an MVP. In the future, I would like to add the following to bring it to MVP:

* Out of 17 tests ran on the 4 separate JS files, 13 passed. 
* Need to populate html templates for intern, engineer, and manager. These would be called in the htmlRenderer.js to populate the output.html  

The psuedo code for the remaining app.js follows:
* User needs to be re-prompted through the original questions if answered yes to add more users
* Troubleshoot passing of data from inquirer in to htmlRenderer.js. 

This was a challenge, but a fun thought experiement.
